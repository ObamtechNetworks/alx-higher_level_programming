"""This module defines a script that reads from stdin line by line
It computes metrics in this format:

Input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1"
<status code> <file size>

For each 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C),
Statistics since the beginning is printed like this:

Total file size: File size: <total size>

where <total size> is the sum of all previous (see input format above)

Number of lines by status code:
possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
if a status code doesnâ€™t appear, nothing is printed for this status code

format: <status code>: <number>
status codes is printed in ascending order
