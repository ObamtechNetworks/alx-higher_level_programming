# 0x02. Python - import & modules
### So, we proceed on learning about import statments and modules in python
# What is a module?
A module is a file containing python definitions and statements. This filename is the module with the suffix '.py' appended
> My understanding
### *In Python, the '__name__' variable is a special variable that holds the name of the current module.*
### It is a 'global variable' - meaning it can be accessd from anywhere within the module *

# Learning Objectives
### At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function dir()
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
